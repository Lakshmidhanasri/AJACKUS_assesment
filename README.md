## ðŸš€ Features
- View, Add, Edit, Delete employees
- Filter, Sort, Search employees
- Pagination (10/25/50/100 entries)
- Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Client-side validation and data handling (no backend)

## ðŸ›  Setup Instructions
1. Open in any IDE (or directly in VS Code)
2. If Freemarker is integrated in Java, run the server.
   - Otherwise, simulate by opening `index.ftl` in a Freemarker test environment
3. Or, use `index.html` version with mock data (if not running server)

## ðŸ“¸ Screenshots
*Add screenshots for desktop and mobile UI*

## ðŸ§  Reflection
### Challenges Faced:
- Implementing dynamic filter/sort together with pagination
- Managing UI state without frameworks

### Improvements:
- Use a build tool (Webpack/Vite)
- Add animations and user feedback
- Connect with backend or persist local data

### âœ… Next Step

Would you like me to now generate the full `script.js` logic and pagination functions based on your setup?
