## 🚀 Features
- View, Add, Edit, Delete employees
- Filter, Sort, Search employees
- Pagination (10/25/50/100 entries)
- Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Client-side validation and data handling (no backend)

## 🛠 Setup Instructions
1. Open in any IDE (or directly in VS Code)
2. If Freemarker is integrated in Java, run the server.
   - Otherwise, simulate by opening `index.ftl` in a Freemarker test environment
3. Or, use `index.html` version with mock data (if not running server)
